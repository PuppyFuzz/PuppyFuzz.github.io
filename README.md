# The useless website.
There’s no point other than to link you to a website.
That’s it.
No easter eggs.
No hidden buttons.
No shady or hidden code.
Just an ad for my small startup.
Try looking through the code. No easter eggs.
A simple text based website.
The readme has no easter eggs.
Stop trying, you won't find luck.
